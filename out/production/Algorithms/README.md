# Algorithms Project

## Overview

This repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented in both JavaScript and Java for educational purposes and practice. 
Each algorithm is contained within its own file for easy reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Usage

After successfully cloning the repository, move to the folder that houses the algorithms. 
From there, you can execute individual algorithm files by running the appropriate command.

#### For Java Algorithms
Go to the Java directory:

- `cd ./Java`

Compile the Java file:

- `javac -d ./compiled <filename.java>`
  
Run the compiled program:

- `java -cp ./compiled <filename>`


#### For JavaScript Algorithms

Go to the JavaScript directory:

- `cd ./JavaScript`

Run the javascript program:

- `node <filename.js>`

Note: Replace `<filename>` with the actual filename you want to run.
